INSTALLATION

To install the perlSGML software, type the following at your shell
prompt:

    perl install.me

Notes on Installation Program

    o	You must be in the same directory as the install.me program.

    o	The program requires Perl 5.  If you are running Perl 4,
	you will have to install the software manually.  Trying to
	run install.me with Perl 4 will generate compilation errors.
	See below for manual installation instructions.

    o	The '#!' line in the installed programs are set to point to
	the Perl executable specified in the installation process.

    o	Programs are updated to include the path location of the
	installed library files.  Hence, you can install the library
	files in any location, and the program will still work.

Manual Installation
-------------------

Manual installation should only be required if you are running
a Perl 4 interpreter.  Some parts of perlSGML are unusable using
Perl 4; see the RELEASE NOTES below for the components of perlSGML
that are Perl 4 compatible.

For the Perl 4 compatible components, do the following:

    o	Copy library (*.pl) files in the "lib" directory to the
	library location you desire.

    o	Copy the program files to the location you want them
	installed.  After copying, you must edit the each file
	as follows:

	    -	Edit the "#!/..." line (the first line of each file)
		to be the complete pathname of your perl interpreter.
		Note, this step is unnecessary for Windows/MSDOS users.

	    -	Add a new line right after the "#!/..." line to
		contain the following:

		    unshift(@INC, "/path/to/lib/files");

		where "/path/to/lib/files/" is the path to where
		copied the library files to.  Note, for Windows/MSDOS
		user, you will have to use "\\" (w/o the quotes)
		as the directory separator if using double quotes
		to delimit the path.  For example:

		    unshift(@INC, "C:\\path\\to\\lib\\files");

		Note, if the location you copied the libraries are
		already part of Perl's standard library search path,
		you do not need to add the unshift() statement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE NOTES

Much of the perlSGML software is still Perl 4 compatible.
The following should run under Perl 4: dtd2html, dtddiff, dtdtree,
dtdview, dtd.pl, sgml.pl.  Perl 4 programs that have been replaced
will be located in the "old" directory of distribution.  As noted
under INSTALLATION, if you you are using Perl 4, you will have to
install the software manually since the "install.me" program requires
Perl 5 to run.

DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is located in the directory doc/.  The documentation
is in HTML.  The documentation is separated in multiple files.
Loading "perlSGML.html" into a WWW browser will get you started.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS

    o	dtd.pl and SGML::DTD do not properly handle
	non-external/internal parameter entity references *outside* of
	markup declarations.  Only external parameter entity references
	ocurring outside of markup declarations are handled properly.

	    Note    The term "internal" refers to a parameter entity
		    whose content is directly defined in the parameter
		    entity declaration and not by an external
		    indentifier.  For example,

		    <!ENTITY % foo "(some|content)">

	This bug will only be a problem if you have DTDs that have
	internal parameter entities that contain complete markup
	declarations which are referenced.  These cases seem to be
	the exception instead of the norm (the bug, or limitation,
	went unnoticed for over 3 years).

BUGS/COMMENTS/SUGGESTIONS?

    If you have any bugs/comments/suggestions, feel free to drop me
    an e-mail message at ehood@medusa.acs.uci.edu.

    If it is a bug you are reporting, please include the following in
    your message:

        o  Version of Perl (can be retrievied by "perl -v").
        o  Version of the program in question.
        o  The exact command-line used to invoke the program.
        o  Error/diagnostic messages from the program.
        o  Any other information that might prove useful.

    Before sending e-mail, make sure the documentation does not already
    have an answer to your question/problem.
