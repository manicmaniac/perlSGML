See the changes file for dtd.pl (dtd_pl.CHG) since changes in it may
affect dtd2html.

==============================================================================
1.5.0	(Aug 21, 1996)

    Enhancements/Changes

        o -catalog has replaced -mapfile.
 
        o The only default catalog(s) file is "catalog" and no
          longer "map.txt".

==============================================================================
1.4.0	(Dec 08, 1995)

    Enhancements/Changes

	o Entity map file syntax has changed to the SGML open catalog
	  format (see dtd_pl.CHG).

	o Support for the envariable SGML_SEARCH_PATH (see dtd_pl.CHG).

	o Support for the envariable SGML_CATALOG_FILES (see dtd_pl.CHG).

	o Base content list on <elem>.html pages may have elements
	  listed in the order they are defined in the content model
	  declaration (-contnosort option).  Occurance indicators,
	  group delimiters, and group connectors are also included in
	  the list.

	o Added support for a general entities page (-ents option).
	  General entities with replaceable character data, CDATA,
	  SDATA, and processing instruction entities are listed.

	o External files can be reference in a description file. Eg:

		<?DTD2HTML #include ents.dsc>

	o Can provide description for entities in the description file.

	o The following command-line options have been renamed:

		-allname	=> -allfile
		-homename	=> -homefile
		-topname	=> -topfile
		-treename	=> -treefile

	  The new option names function the same way as the old names.

	  Renaming was done to be more consistent with other command-line
	  options.

	o Headers in the attribute pages now contain an anchor so they
	  can be the source of a hyperlink.  The NAME value of the
	  anchor is the name of the attribute (in lowercase).  Eg.

		<H2><A NAME="src">SRC</A></H2>

	o Generated HTML files contain
	  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN"> declaration.
	  Also, markup create by dtd2html conforms to the HTML 2.0
	  standard (hopefully :-).

	o A few cosmetic changes to HTML output.

	o New command-line options:

		-contnosort	     : Base content list "as is"
		-ents		     : Create entity page
		-entsfile <filename> : Set filename of entity page
		-modelwidth <#>      : Set output width of content model
				       declarations
		-entslist	     : Output general entities in DTD to
				       stdout in description file format.

==============================================================================
1.3.3	(Mar 31, 1994)

    Bug Fixes

	o Short descriptions are treated properly when updating a
	  description file.

	o Shared descriptions do not get propogated to individual
	  element descriptions when updating a description file.

1.3.2	(Dec 14, 1994)

    Bug Fixes

	o Fixed where <>& were not be converted into entity references
	  in the HTML output.

	o The defualt URL for the documentation is now consistent with

==============================================================================
1.3.1	(Dec 12, 1994)

    New Functionality/Enhancements:

	o Able to specify short descriptions of elements listed in
	  All Elements and in element pages via the description file.

	o Added -nodocurl option.

	o Some cosmetic changes to generated HTML.

    Bug Fixes

	o See dtd_pl.CHG for changes in it that affect dtd2html.

	    - A bug in the internal extract_elem_names() in dtd.pl
	      caused elements with '-' in the name to have incorrect
	      links put in content model declaration pages.

	o Element identifiers that equal reserved words are correctly
	  recognized.  For example, an element called "EMPTY" would
	  not have any links created for it.  The new DTDis_element()
	  function in dtd.pl is used to make these recognitions.

	o Remove BR element from TITLE's in some HTML files created.
	  BR is not allowed in a TITLE element.


==============================================================================
1.3.0	(July 08, 1994)

    New Functionality/Enhancements:

	o A "quick reference" output (-qref or -qrefdl).

	o Support for updating the element description file when a DTD
	  changes (-updateel).

	o In the spirit of SGML, only the first element description
	  encountered is used.  However, an empty description, or a
	  description with only the <P> tag, is ignored.

	o Removed the word "Goto" in the links at the bottom of each
	  page.  It was bad style.

	o The footer on each page containing the name of the DTD links
	  to the home page.

	o New command-line options:

		-keepold -noreport -qref -qrefdl -qrefhtag -reportonly 
		-updateel

	
==============================================================================
1.2.1	(June 01, 1994)

    New Functionality/Enhancements:
	
	o Tree elements with "..." now link to the 'complete' entry
	  in the tree, and the 'complete' entry links to the element
	  page.

	o "Goto Tree" link on an element page, goes to tree page
	  scrolled to the location of the 'complete' element entry.

	
==============================================================================

	  element description file.

	o Attribute page is not created for an element if the element
	  has no attributes.

	o Content declaration page is not created if the element is
	  defined with EMPTY content.

	o Now hyperlinks exist for elements listed in the content
	  declaration page.

	o Added the -verbose option.  Now one can get the gory details
	  of what dtd2html is doing.

	o A list of anchors of top-most elements are created at the
	  top of the tree page if more than one top-most element is
	  defined in the DTD.  The anchors allow quick scrolling to
	  top of each tree.

    Bug Fixes:

	o NOTATION declared value keyword attributes are recognized.
